    <h1> GET TO KNOW AYO</h1>
    <p> My name is Imoleayo Dodo-Williams. I was born and raised in Lagos state. I'm a graduate of Osun State University. I'm a lover of God, good music, good food and I love my husband, Oluwagbemiga. I'm an introvert by default settings but an extrovert when i'm around people/persons that i'm comfortable with.  </p>
    <p> About a week ago, i started a program in Full Stack Development at GoMyCode Academy and i'm amazed at my progess so far. I've learnt to understood the web and how it works. I've been working on some projects using GIT and GITHUB. Now I'm currently working on how to build a website using HTML. It has been nothing but amazing and i look forward to learn more and progress in the course of my program</p>
